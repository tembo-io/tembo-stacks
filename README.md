# Data Plane

Dataplanes are where Postgres runs.

## Conductor

Dataplanes receive the desired state of databases from the control plane. The dataplanes report back the actual status of database to the control plane.

The conductor is responsible for:
- Dequeuing desired state from control plane, and applying into Kubernetes
- Enqueuing back to the control plane the actual state of resources


## Tembo operator

The operator is responsible for managing Stacks. The operator depends on [Cloud Native PG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) for managing postgres. The operator adds additional features such as extension management.

### Tembo pod init

This worklow is a Kubernetes mutating webhook and is a subcomponent of the operator.
